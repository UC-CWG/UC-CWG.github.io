## Tutorial

[https://github.com/mayamarie4897/geospatial-intro](https://github.com/mayamarie4897/geospatial-intro)

## Pre-reqs

It is not necessary for the tutorials, but for those who are interested [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) is some information on creating a Google developer account to gain access to the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key). The API requires a billing account with Google, but you get a $300 free trial which should cover basic geospatial data analysis (just make sure to watch your account!).
